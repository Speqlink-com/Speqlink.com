                    What began as a small startup in Nairobi has blossomed into a community of
                    innovators who believe technology should serve Africa. Our culture is our compass — it guides
                    our decisions, shapes our products, and reminds us that behind every line of code is a person
                    striving to make a difference. We're not just building the future of African technology; we're
                    ensuring it's a future worth living in.
